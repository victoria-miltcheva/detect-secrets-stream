# Adding a New Detector

Adding a new type of detector to detect-secrets-suite is a multi-stage process. You must:

- Understand the secret signature and use cases; What is it's format and how does it appear in code?
- Understand the secret verification, owner resolution, and revocation process.
- Develop a detector which becomes part of [`IBM/detect-secrets`](https://github.com/IBM/detect-secrets)
- Enable the new detector in [`IBM/detect-secrets-stream`](https://github.com/IBM/detect-secrets-stream) by supporting verification, owner resolution, and with the approval of the token type's internal service owner, revocation.
- [optional] Contribute the new detector to the upstream project `Yelp/detect-secrets` on github.com.

## Skills Required

- Python
- Python test frameworks
- Regular expressions
- Knowledge of the secret type, its specification & its usage
- Git
