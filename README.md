# Detect Secrets Stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/detect-secrets-stream.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/detect-secrets-stream.svg?branch=main)

## Description

Detect Secrets Stream is a server tool which ingests metadata of all (public repositories by default, private repositories are opt-in only) git pushes on your company's GitHub Enterprise server. For each push, it [scans](./docs/detect-secrets-stream-faq.md#what-file-contents-do-you-scan) the push contents for secrets. Once found and verified, secrets metadata will be stored in a database, and the raw secret will be stored in Vault.

There is a companion Admin tool which enables org admins to:

- Opt-in their private repository for scanning
- Add security folks to be notified of leaked tokens

Under the hood, the server tool uses the developer tool to scan for secrets. Read [IBM/detect-secrets](https://github.com/IBM/detect-secrets) for more info about developer tool.

## Architecture

## Development

### Tool dependencies

- `python3`
  - If you are using macOs, you can use `pyenv` to install Python 3: `brew install pyenv; pyenv install 3.8.5;`
  - Optionally, you can set your system's default Python to Python 3 `pyenv global 3.8.5`. Then restart your shell. Run `python --version` to validate the default Python version is 3.
- `docker` https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- `skaffold`, v1.12.1 and above
- `kustomize`, v3.8.1 and above. Do **NOT** use the version bundled with `kubectl`, as it does not support some options use by this project (e.g. replicas).
- `container-structure-test`, used for docker image validation - [installation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test#installation).
- `pipenv`, used to manage all Python dependencies.

You can install all the tools except docker and python 3 with one liner below

```shell
brew install kustomize skaffold container-structure-test pipenv
```

### Python package dependencies

- Navigate into the cloned repo
- Start the `pipenv` shell with `pipenv shell`
- Install Python dependencies with `pipenv install --dev`
- Initialize the `pre-commit` tool with `pre-commit install`

## Secrets

Example secrets can be found in [secrets.template](./secrets.template/) (more docs coming). For your local dev environment, some secrets are auto-generated. For prod environments, you will need to supply the real secrets.

### Local dev secrets

To set up your local dev secrets, first run `./kustomize_envs/dev/gen-secret.sh`. It will create two hidden folders under `/kustomize_envs/dev/`:

- `secret_generated/` containing automatically-generated secrets. Secrets get regenerated when re-running `gen-secret.sh`.
- `secret_manual/` containing manually-entered secrets. Running `gen-secret.sh` will generate a template for secrets under this folder. You do need to manually update each secret to match your environment. Re-running `gen-secret.sh` will not overwrite the files if they are non-empty.

This table contains information on what the values of the manually-entered secrets should be set to:
| File name | Value |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.key` | The test GitHub App's private key. Download this from the GitHub App config UI. |
| `env.txt` | The test GitHub App's app ID. Obtained from the GitHub App config UI. |
| `db2consv_zs.lic` | The IBM DB2 license certificate file. You can read more about how to retrieve it [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.1?topic=configuring-db2-licenses). This is only needed if looking for DB2 for z or DB2 for i secrets. |
| `email.conf` | Your company's internal email regex. Replace `mycompany.com` with your company's email domain. |
| `ghe_revocation.token` | The Jenkins job trigger token to revoke the GHE token. |
| `github.conf` | `github.mycompany.com` - replace this with your company's GHE domain. `tokens` - a list of GitHub API tokens (no scopes necessary). This token pool is necessary for when a single token's rate limit has been reached. `<org>` and `<repo>` should be replaced with the organization/repository containing the org set configuration for private repository scanning.|
| `iam.conf` | The IBM Cloud IAM API key for an admin account which can resolve an IBM Cloud IAM token owner. |
| `kafka.conf` | `brokers_sasl` - comma-separated Kafka broker list. For example `broker-1:9093,broker-2:9093,broker-3:9093`. `api_key` - Kafka API key to publish and consume from the queue. When using [IBM Cloud Events Stream service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams), you can obtain such value from the Events Stream console by navigating to the Service credentials panel and creating a new service credential. `brokers_sasl` is the value of `kafka_brokers_sasl` (without `"` or spaces) from your service credential. `api_key` is the value of `api_key` from your service credential. |
| `revoker_urls.conf` | Replace `github.mycompany.com` with your company's GHE URL, `artifactory` with your company's artifactory URL, and `jenkins` with your company's Jenkins URL, which should contain a Jenkins job to revoke the GHE token. |

### Prod secrets

Besides the secrets mentioned from [Local dev secrets](#local-dev-secrets), for production environments, you also need to prepare secrets which are auto-generated in the dev environment.

This table contains information on what the values of the dev secrets should be set to:
| File name | Value |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `basic_auth.conf` | Basic auth info for ingestion and revoker layer. |
| `dc_iv_file` and `dc_key_file` | The key file used for deterministic encryption. This will be replaced by non-deterministic encryption later. |
| `gd_db.conf` | Database related secrets. |
| `hmac.key` | HMAC key used in hashing algorithm. |
| `encryption.key` and `encryption.key.pub` | Encryption key used in non-deterministic encryption. |
| `vault.conf` | Vault related secrets. DSS uses approle for auth and KV v1 as secret engine. |

## Tests

### Unit tests

You don't need to unlock secrets when running unit tests.

```shell
make test
```

#### Run just unit tests

```shell
make test-unit
```

#### Run a subset of the unit tests

This provides faster feedback if you are just writing code for a module.

```shell
# The part after last dash (-) corresponding to folder name under detect_secrets_stream
# For example, run unit test for just files under bp_lookup
make test-unit-bp_lookup
# Run unit test for just files under pi_cleaner
make test-unit-pi_cleaner
```

### End 2 end test

This requires a personal or staging environment. See [kustomize_envs/dev/README.md](kustomize_envs/dev/README.md) for more details.

## Utilities

This repo has provided a utility module which enables an admin to do many routine tasks. The utility is invoked though `python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util`

Running the utility requires several environment variables. An example environment variable file (`.env.example`) has been provided.

From a `fish` shell, you can do something like below

```shell
cp .env.example .env.prod
env (grep -v '^#' .env.prod | xargs -n1) python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util --help
```

### Decrypt raw tokens

Based on id

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util decrypt-token-by-id [token_id]
```

Based on UUID

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util decrypt-token-by-uuid [uuid]
```

### Validating Admin Tool Org Admins

```bash

python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util get-org-admins [ORG_NAME]
```

### Backfill tokens

```bash
# export require env vars

# macos
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util backfill --size=10000 --from $(date -j -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2019" +"%s") --to $(date -j -
f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 EDT 2019" +"%s")

# linux
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util backfill --size=10000 --from $(date -d '06/12/2012 07:21:22' +"%s") --to $(date -d '06/12/2012 08:21:22' +"%s")
```

### Manually ingest token

Manually add a commit to the `diff-scan` queue.

Note: must set `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` , `GD_KAFKA_CONF` environment variables.

`KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` is the name of the Kafka client used for manual ingestion. It can be anything, such as `manual-ingest`
`GD_KAFKA_CONF` points to the Kafka configuration file. The production config is stored under `kustomize_envs/prod-secrets/secret/kafka.conf`. The one below is an example of what should be contained in the config file.

```conf
[kafka]
brokers_sasl = my_sasl1.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000,my_sasl2.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000,my_sasl3.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:9000
api_key = my_api_key
```

Sample usage:

```bash
# export require env vars
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util ingest-commit -r <repo> -c <commit>
```

More options: running the command above with `--help` will reveal help info on more options. For example, if you know the branch and repository's visibility, you can also supply these.
By default, it assumes the commit is from the master branch and the repository's visibility is public.

### and more...

```shell
python -m detect_secrets_stream.util.secret_util --help
```

## PI Disposal Process

The mechanism for removing old secrets is a [cronjob](/kustomize_envs/base/pi_cleaner/cronjob.yaml) which cleans PI on a daily basis.

It removes the following PI for all tokens that have been remediated for over seven days:

- Owner email
- Secret
- Encrypted secret
- Other factors
- Author name
- Author email
- Pusher username
- Pusher email
- Committer name
- Committer email
- Repo slug
- Location url

## Re-validation Process

Every four hours, a [cronjob]('/kustomize_envs/base/revalidation') checks if all live tokens in the database are still live and updates their statuses accordingly.
